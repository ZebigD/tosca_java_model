# tosca_java_model

Java implementation of OASIS TOSCA Metamodel... - actually a Groovy implementation :)

It is based on the [TOSCA simple profile](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.1/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.1.html) in version 1.1 

This a work in progress.

The purpose of this library is to provide a framework for 
- parsing and code checking
- workflow generation
- graphic representation generation
- data flow matrix generation
...


voil√†.
